# Exeter Web Application
## Executive Summary
  Social Media is a staple of modern connectivity and communication. With this web application, students will be able to create a profile, connect with other like-minded students, post ideas and search for others, and discuss working together on projects with creative rooms.
## Business Objectives
  This application will bring students together to create projects based on their similar interests and enable them to develop new and improved features through the ease of communicating in public or private rooms. The creation of a profile to showcase projects, interests, and basic personal information will greatly affect what the user sees on their app client. Lastly, ideas can be easily seen with the help of a posting system, as well as friending and searching systems to help curate content for users based on their friends and interests.
## Background
  This project has been initiated to create a simple way to connect students and provide them with the tools they need to collaborate and create projects of their own with ease.
## Scope
  Features of the Exeter Web Application include, a login or sign-up screen for controlled access, a profile page to list basic personal information, interests, and projects, as well as a rooms system to house conversations of various topics. Furthermore, a friend system to add students with similar interests, a wall of posts to share and read others ideas, and a search function to find specific rooms and posts.
## Functional Requirements
  There are five main attributes of this project. First, a login screen with inputs for username and password, a sign-up button to allow users to create a new profile based on the values of the inputs, and a login button to authorize users with profiles created.
Second, a profile page displaying information such as name, date of birth, and location, as well as a picture, biography, and a list of interests that the user can edit with a click of a button, through the use of forms. Third, on the main page, a side display of conversation rooms based on what interests were provided in profile creation. When a room is clicked, the user should be directed to a chat where they can view the conversation and type their own responses. A follow button will allow the user to stay connected with a room. Fourth, if a user clicks on another students username, a popup will appear with their name and a few interests. A button will also be present to send a friend request to that user. On the main page, there will be a list to the side displaying friends, pending friend requests, and requests sent to the user. Fifth, centered on the main page, a wall of posts from students the user has friended and/or share similar interests, the ability to create a post, and the ability to comment on other posts.
